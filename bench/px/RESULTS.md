# PX benchmark — text vs image tokens (`npm run bench:px`)

The honey-px read path: render dense read-only bulk to PNG pages
(pxpipe `renderTextToImages`, reflow — the same renderer `pxpipe export` uses)
and `Read` the images. Image tokens estimated with Anthropic's pixel formula
`ceil(w×h/750)`; text tokens with the same tokenizer pair as every other bench
here. Estimates, not billed usage — no API key run.

## Tokens (2026-07-04, pxpipe-proxy 0.8.0)

| corpus | chars | chars/tok | text tok (claude) | text tok (o200k) | pages | img tok (est) | saved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| dense JS (bin/eso.js) | 2,853 | 3.18 | 898 | 783 | 1 | 184 | **80%** |
| dense JS (eso/index.js) | 7,250 | 3.42 | 2,122 | 1,902 | 1 | 419 | **80%** |
| dense JSON (dict_array_100) | 13,734 | 3.15 | 4,355 | 4,986 | 1 | 770 | **82%** |
| dense JSON (time_series_50) | 8,991 | 2.68 | 3,360 | 3,765 | 1 | 502 | **85%** |
| md prose (skills/honey/SKILL.md) | 9,998 | 3.69 | 2,713 | 2,527 | 1 | 569 | **79%** |
| md prose (README.md) | 20,171 | 3.44 | 5,857 | 5,364 | 1 | 1,104 | **81%** |
| repo slab (eso/*.js joined) | 22,468 | 3.17 | 7,094 | 6,416 | 1 | 1,238 | **83%** |
| **TOTAL** | | | **26,399** | | | **4,786** | **82%** |

Wins shrink as chars/token rises (image cost is fixed by pixels); on this corpus
even markdown prose clears the bar. README render dropped 10 glyphs (emoji not
in the atlas) — another silent-loss channel to know about.

## Read-back check (in-session, Fable 5 — small n, self-scored)

Protocol: `pxpipe export` on eso/index.js + time_series_50 fixture (16,309
chars → 1 page, 994 img tok vs 4,408 text, −77.5%). The agent read ONLY the
PNG (neither file previously read as text in the session), stated concrete
facts, then grep-verified each against the source.

**14 claims → 12 correct, 2 wrong.** Correct: `!eson/1` header const, five
exact error strings (incl. `Section ${name} expected ${fields.length} cells,
got ${cells.length}`), all five config values from the JSON
(`min_items_to_analyze: 5`, `similarity_threshold: 0.8`, `last_fraction:
0.15`, …), `"transform": "smart_crusher"`, host-0/1/2 values.

**Both misses were long byte-exact strings, and both were silent
confabulations, not "can't read":**

- NAME regex read as `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` — actual `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]` (missed the `.`)
- timestamp offset read as `…020402400:00` — actual `…020402+00:00`

That is precisely pxpipe's documented failure mode (their blind-read audit:
~63% on dense identifiers) and why the skill's guards exist: never for files
you'll `Edit`, never trust an exact string seen only in an image — `Grep` it
first; `factsheet.txt` carries precision tokens as text.

## Verdict

- **Token axis: real and large** (−79…85% here; pxpipe's own end-to-end
  measured bill cut is 59–70% — smaller because most requests aren't imaged).
- **Quality axis: gist-safe, byte-unsafe.** Comprehension of structure, error
  strings, and config values held; long identifiers corrupted silently at
  ~2/14 in this tiny sample.
- Not comparable to the lossless ESON/TOON deltas — different axis. PX sits
  beside CCR in the lossy tier: CCR drops rows recoverably, PX keeps all
  content in view at pixel prices with byte-exactness risk.
- A proper comprehension panel (multi-model, blinded, n≥100 like
  bench/headroom/COMPREHENSION.md) needs a live API key — open.
