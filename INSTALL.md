# Installing Honey

Honey installs the same way Ponytail and Caveman do: a Claude Code plugin
marketplace one-liner, a unified one-line installer that auto-detects every agent
you have, or a manual per-tool copy. Pick whichever fits.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** on your PATH (the installer and the Claude Code hooks are tiny Node
  scripts). Check with `node --version`.
- `git` is used by the one-line installer when available; it falls back to a
  tarball/zip download if not.

## Option A — Claude Code plugin marketplace (recommended for Claude Code)

```
/plugin marketplace add Green-PT/honey-for-devs
/plugin install honey@greenpt
```

This installs the `honey` skill, the `/honey` command, and a SessionStart hook
that keeps Honey active across sessions once you turn it on.

Usage:

- `/honey` — turn Honey on at `full` intensity
- `/honey lite` · `/honey full` · `/honey ultra` — set intensity
- `/honey off` — turn it off

A `🍯 honey:<mode>` badge appears in your statusline while it's active.

## Option B — One-line installer (all agents)

macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Green-PT/honey-for-devs/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell 5.1+):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Green-PT/honey-for-devs/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer detects which agents you have, runs each one's native install
pathway, and skips the rest. It's safe to re-run.

### Flags

Pass flags through the pipe with `bash -s --`, e.g.
`curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --with-init`.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| *(none)* / `--all` | Install detected CLI agents + statusline badge |
| `--minimal` | Plugin/extension installs only; skip the statusline wiring |
| `--only <id>` | Restrict to one agent (repeatable). IDs: `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `gemini`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `cline`, `copilot-editor`, `opencode`, `kiro`, `agents` |
| `--with-init` | Also drop editor rule files into the **current directory** |
| `--dry-run` | Print every action without writing anything |
| `--list` | Show the agent matrix and what's detected |
| `--uninstall` | Remove Honey from detected agents |

### Manual (no piping)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Green-PT/honey-for-devs.git
cd honey-for-devs
node bin/install.js --list           # see what's detected
node bin/install.js --dry-run --all  # preview
node bin/install.js                  # install
```

## Option C — Per-tool manual copy

Each editor reads an always-on rule file. Copy the matching one into your project
(or the tool's global config dir):

| Tool | File | Destination |
|------|------|-------------|
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/honey.mdc` | `<project>/.cursor/rules/` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/honey.md` | `<project>/.windsurf/rules/` |
| Cline | `.clinerules/honey.md` | `<project>/.clinerules/` |
| Copilot (editor) | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `<project>/.github/` |
| Kiro | `.kiro/steering/honey.md` | `<project>/.kiro/steering/` or `~/.kiro/steering/` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/AGENTS.md` | `<project>/.opencode/` |
| Aider / Zed / universal | `AGENTS.md` | `<project>/` |

These files are generated from `skills/honey/SKILL.md`; don't edit them by hand —
edit the source and run `node scripts/build-rules.js`.

## Uninstall

```bash
# via the one-liner
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Green-PT/honey-for-devs/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall

# or from a clone
node bin/install.js --uninstall
```

In Claude Code you can also run `/plugin uninstall honey@greenpt`. Per-repo rule
files you copied are left in place — delete them manually if you want them gone.
